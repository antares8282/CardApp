# TheOne: Codex vs skill-creator-plus

This project compares **OpenAI Codex** skill docs with **Claude skill-creator-plus**. When editing CODEX.md or skill files:

- **CODEX.md** is the single source of truth for the comparison.
- Use the project skill **theone-codex-skills** (`.cursor/skills/theone-codex-skills/SKILL.md`) for full context on locations, invocation, frontmatter, and distribution.
- Preserve the structure and tone of CODEX.md (bulleted differences, neutral comparison).
